 # String Calculator

This project provides a simple implementation of a **String Calculator** in Ruby, along with RSpec tests to verify its functionality. The calculator parses a string of numbers separated by specific delimiters, performs validations, and returns their sum.


## Installation

1. Ensure that **Ruby** is installed on your system. You can verify by running:
